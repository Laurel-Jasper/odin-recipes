      <h3 class="hero-h3">Description</h3>

      <p class="hero-p">
        As a quick translation, okonomi (as you like it) + yaki (grilled) stands
        for a simple pancake batter made from flour, eggs and stock flavoured
        water (usually dashi), filled with cabbage and other tasty ingredients
        like pork, shrimp or corn.
      </p> <br>

      <p class="hero-p">
        You’ll find this classic Japanese street food dish at markets, festivals
        and specialty okonomiyaki restaurants where it’s cooked on large hot
        plates in the middle of the table. It’s also a popular meal Japanese
        families will cook at home, usually tweaking the recipe to suit their
        own tastes, methods or to use up ingredients they already have on hand.
      </p> <br>

      <h3 class="hero-h3">Ingredients - For the pancake base</h3>

      <ul class="hero-unordered-list">
        <li>
          Pork / Bacon – While Osaka/Kansai-style okonomiyaki is usually topped
          with thin strips of pork belly, at home we’ll substitute with bacon
          slices for convenience. If you’re after thinly sliced pork, shabu
          shabu hot pot style, you can usually find these at Asian grocers in
          the freezer section.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cabbage – We usually use Asian cabbage (known as wombok or napa
          cabbage), but frequently make it with savoy or cannonball cabbage and
          they work just fine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flour – The batter is made with a mix of all purpose flour and
          cornstarch to give it a little extra crispiness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dashi Powder – We use dashi powder instead of dashi stock as it’s much
          quicker to use, especially when you only need such a small amount to
          flavour the batter.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="hero-h3">Ingredients - For the toppings</h3>

      <ul class="hero-unordered-list">
        <li>
          Okonomiyaki Sauce – This is the key to the classic okonomiyaki
          flavour. You can make your own homemade okonomiyaki sauce with a few
          simple sauces you probably already have on hand, buy it online (look
          for the “Otafuku” brand), or from Asian grocers. It’s similar(ish) to
          yakisoba sauce or tonkatsu sauce, so feel free to use either if you
          already have one on hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Kewpie Mayonnaise – It’s best to use Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise
          because it has a unique flavour compared to regular mayonnaise. You’ll
          sometimes find it in well stocked supermarkets (head to the
          International aisle), online or from Asian grocers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dried Seaweed Flakes – Known as aonori in Japanese, this is finely
          chopped seaweed that adds a beautiful colour and subtle flavour to the
          pancakes. Substitute with nori seaweed if you need to (tear it or
          slice it up into small flakes).
        </li>
        <li>
          Dried Bonito Flakes – Known as katsuoboshi in Japanese, this is dried,
          smoked bonito fish that is finely shaved into flakes. The umami
          flavour is out of this world, and not as ‘fishy’ as it smells. We also
          love watching the flakes curl up and dance when topped over piping hot
          okonomiyaki! If you’re not a fan, just leave it out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pickled Red Ginger (Optional) – Also known as beni shoga, it adds a
          hint of tangy flavour and crunch. It’s also a popular topping for
          takoyaki. Super easy to make your own red pickled ginger at home! It’s
          becoming more common at regular supermarkets, otherwise buy from an
          Asian grocer or online. If you don’t have any or can’t source it, just
          leave it out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Japanese 7 Spice (Optional) – Also known as shichimi togarashi, this
          seasoning is as common as salt and pepper in Japanese cuisine, usually
          paired with aonori. You can buy it online, find it at Asian grocers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="hero-h3">Steps</h3>

      <ol class="hero-ordered-list">
        <li>
          Fry the bacon until cooked through and crispy, then set aside to cool.
          No need to use oil here, as the bacon will release its own oil as you
          cook it.
        </li>
        <li>
          To make the batter, combine the eggs and dashi powder dissolved in the
          warm water in a small mixing bowl and beat gently. In a separate large
          mixing bowl add your flour and cornflour, then pour over with the egg
          and dashi stock mixture. Stir and combine until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, add the shredded cabbage, half of the green onion slices, cooked
          bacon and corn into the batter mixture. Mix until all the dry
          ingredients are evenly coated (but don’t overmix, we want to keep that
          cabbage nice and fluffy). There shouldn’t be much excess batter liquid
          at the bottom – if there is, just add a little more chopped cabbage
          and mix through gently.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scoop out the mixture onto a large frying pan over medium heat. We
          like aiming for a circle shape about 10 cm / 4 inches wide. Cook each
          pancake for a few mins per side, until lightly browned on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer your freshly cooked pancakes to serving plates, then top with
          drizzles of kewpie mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce. For even better
          tasting okonomiyaki, top with sprinklings of dried seaweed flakes,
          bonito flakes and a few slices of green onion to taste. You can also
          optionally top with the pickled ginger and Japanese 7 spice here.
        </li>
