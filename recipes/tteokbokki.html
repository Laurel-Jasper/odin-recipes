    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Tteokbokki</strong> is a highly popular Korean street food and a delicious comfort
      food you can easily make at home. The spicy, slightly sweet, and chewy
      rice cakes are simply addictive!
    </p>

    <p>
      Tteokbokki (also spelled ddukbokki, ddeokbokki, dukbokki or topokki),
      떡볶이, is a beloved Korean rice cake dish with many variations and a rich
      history. Literally translated as “stir-fried rice cake”, this dish is made
      with garaetteok, a cylinder-shaped white rice cake. This spicy rice cake
      dish is enormously popular as a street food and also often enjoyed at
      home.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Tteok / Rice Cakes</strong> – You can use the long cylinder-shaped rice cakes
        known as garae-tteok, or flat rice cakes sliced diagonally. It’s more
        common to use the cylinders, but the flat rice cakes will taste just as
        good. The best place to look for them is the fridge or freezer section
        of Korean convenience stores or Asian groceries, but you can also find
        them dried. Dried rice cakes will need to be soaked for around 3 hours
        (or overnight) before using.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gochujang</strong> – One of the key ingredients to the dish, regular gochujang
        has more of a tomato / sweet taste than chilli heat, although you can
        buy an extra hot version if you prefer. We’ve found these at regular
        supermarkets, Asian groceries or online. Note that the level of heat can
        vary depending on the style or brand of gochujang that you buy. If
        you’re unsure, start with a small amount and build it up from there. If
        you can’t source gochujang, you can substitute (per tbsp) with 1 tbsp of
        red pepper flakes blended with 2 tsp of soy sauce and a pinch of sugar.
        The flavour won’t be as complex, but it should get you through.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dashi Stock</strong> – this gives the unique umami flavour to the dish. There are
        two styles you can use as the base for this recipe: 1) Konbu dashi –
        less intense seaweed based flavour. OR 2) Katsuo dashi – intense anchovy
        kick. For the best flavour we recommend the stronger anchovy version.
        The smell is strong while cooking, but doesn’t taste “fishy” in the
        final dish – instead it gives the dish a mouth-watering umami kick. Feel
        free to choose the right style for your tastes, or substitute with
        vegetable or chicken stock if you prefer.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Add water dashi stock powder to a wok or large frypan and bring to the
        boil. Add in the gochujang paste, red chilli flakes, sugar and soy sauce
        and stir into a luscious, fragrant soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pop in the rice cakes and green onion and bring back to the boil, then
        simmer for around 10 minutes until the rice cakes have softened,
        stirring frequently so they don’t stick to the bottom. You’ll know it’s
        done when the sauce becomes thick and glossy and the rice cakes are
        nicely chewy (go on, test one, you know you want to!). If the rice cakes
        aren’t soft enough, add in a little more water and continue to cook
        until ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just before serving, pour in the sesame oil and give it a good stir.
        Garnish with more sliced green onion, then serve piping hot and
        delicious!
